Code Repository for the Process and Metrics for Software Development Course project

This was a project made with a group of seven people.
This is a website that uses bootstrap and makes it possible for people to make reservations in a restaurant and receive e-mails and SMS, to allow the users to confirm that they will be really present in the restaurant at the time they have maked.

We've used #Scrum# methodologie in this project.

For the SMS part need to thank to @diogoaguiar that payed for the SMS's.
